# **Phonebook Management System** üì±

The **Phonebook Management System** is an Object-Oriented C++ program that allows users to manage contact information such as names and phone numbers. Users can perform various operations, including adding, updating, searching, and deleting contact records. The system stores the contact information in a binary file for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

This system demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like classes, objects, and encapsulation in C++.

## **Overview** üåü

This **Phonebook Management System** allows the user to:

- **Create a Phonebook**: Store new contact information (name, phone number).
- **Search Contacts**: Search for a contact by name.
- **Update Contacts**: Modify existing contact details, including the name or phone number.
- **Delete Contacts**: Remove contacts from the phonebook.
- **Store Information**: All contacts are saved in a binary file (`phone.txt`), making the system persistent.

The program utilizes Object-Oriented principles in C++ and is designed to handle a large number of contacts efficiently.

## **Features** ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Create Phonebook**: Users can add multiple contacts with their names and phone numbers.
- **Search for Contacts**: Easily search for contacts by name.
- **Update Contact Information**: Modify a contact's details such as name or phone number.
- **Delete Contacts**: Remove a contact from the phonebook.
- **Persistent Storage**: Contact data is saved in a binary file (`phone.txt`), so it persists across program executions.
- **Text-Based Interface**: Simple and intuitive menu-driven user interface.

## **Technology Stack** ‚ö°

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **File Handling**: Binary file operations to store and retrieve contact information.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, Encapsulation, and Object Manipulation.

## **System Requirements** üíª

- **Operating System**: Any system that supports C++ (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- **Compiler**: A C++ compiler such as GCC.
- **Hardware**: A computer with basic specifications.
